# Responsive Principles

<http://paulrobertlloyd.github.io/responsive-principles>

This reponsitory contains three principles (currently in draft) for responsive web design, as outlined in my talk [Responsive Principles](https://speakerdeck.com/paulrobertlloyd/responsive-principles-front-end-london-may-2015).

This site will be developed over time, and include links to relevant resources and tools. For the moment, please review each principle, and provide feedback, either by raising an [issue](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/responsive-principles/issues), or using the [#RWDPrinciples](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RWDPrinciples) hashtag.
