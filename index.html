title: Responsive Principles
---
<h1>{{ site.title }}</h1>
<p>In 2014, Ethan Marcotte <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/cssday/106869929">suggested the need for a framework for responsive web design</a>, one that was <q>not about execution, but about philosophy and quality</q>. This framework would help us frame the continuing discussion about our practice, and act as a reference point for measuring the appropriateness of our work.</p>

<p>We can start the work of building this framework, by agreeing upon a set design principles, each working in service of a broader goal, that of building a web that is and remains accessible to all.<p>

<ol>
{% for principle in site.principles %}
    <li>
        <article class="c-principle">
            <header>
                <h1 class="c-principle">{{ principle.title }}</h1>
            </header>
            <p class="c-principle">{{ principle.description }}</p>
        </article>
    </li>
{% endfor %}
</ol>
